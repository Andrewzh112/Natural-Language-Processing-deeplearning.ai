## About this Specialization

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This  technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language, uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio.

By the end of this Specialization, you will be ready to design NLP applications that  perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to  translate languages and summarize text, and even build chatbots. These  and other NLP applications are going to be at the forefront of the  coming transformation to an [AI-powered future](https://bit.ly/3dRdU2m).

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. [Younes Bensouda Mourri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/younes-bensouda-mourri-8749b9a9/) is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://bit.ly/3fexxkV). [Łukasz Kaiser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaszkaiser/) is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of  Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer  paper. 

## Applied Learning Project

**This Specialization will equip you with the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build cutting-edge NLP systems:**

• Use logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors to implement  sentiment analysis, complete analogies, and translate words, and use  locality sensitive hashing for approximate nearest neighbors.

•  Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to  autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and  identify part-of-speech tags for words.

• Use dense and recurrent  neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and  Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named  entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions. 

• Use  encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine  translation of complete sentences, text summarization,  question-answering and to build chatbots. Models covered include T5,  BERT, transformer, reformer, and more!
